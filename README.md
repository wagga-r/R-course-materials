# R-course-materials
Several previous face-to-face and hands-on beginners' learning courses for R have been held at CSU (Graham Centre, Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga NSW Australia) and NSW DPI over recent years. The resources used as part of those courses are made available here for your use. In addition, the local R-users' group ("cRow" or "Wagga-R") holds monthly meetings where new features in R and RStudio are discussed; the resources from those meetings will also appear here.

## 1. Script files
The R script files can be run using R to demonstrate the various features of the R language. We recommend running these under a project in the RStudio desktop graphical-user-interface software. RStudio is free for personal use and runs on most hardware (PC, Mac, Unix, Linux).

## 2. Data files
The course materials include several, small, data files in various formats (txt, prn, tab, csv, xlx, xlsx) to illustrate reading data into R.

## 3. Output files
The scripts (when run) will occassionally produce example output files. They will be available here in case you experience errors and wish to see what the output files should look like.
